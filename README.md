### Introduction 
The game was originally inspired by an iOS game **Shades** developed by UOVO ApS. 
This was built as my **first project** on the **Web Development Immersive** course in **General Assembly, London**.  

### How To Play
Make rows of same color to earn points and clear the board. Stack bricks of the same color 
to make a darker color. Move bricks from left to right by using **right and left arrow keys**. Use **down arrow key**
to boost bricks to the bottom.

The aim of the game is to earn as much points as possible. The game will end once there is no empty space left for
new bricks to be positioned.
